# pix2pix GAN in pytorch
Image to Image translation modules, including dataloader setup, vanilla pix to pix model, cloud training and test apis in Pytorch
## About:
This is a pytorch implementation of paired image-to-image translation, i.e. converting one image to another type by analysing the relation amongst the two images.
The paper was published in *year* by *Authors*.
